# Homework_5 Work_Day_Scheduler
This is Work Day Scheduler application. When I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  

When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours in Pacific Time Zone. When I view time blocks for that day, each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. 

When I click a time block, I can enter an event. When I click save button for that event, text for that event is saved in local storage.

When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
